This is a light-weight, non-compliant implementation of the JSR-170 Java Content Repository API.

DATA MODEL
==========

The data model is rather straightforward.

REPOSITORY MODEL
================

Each repository may contain multiple workspaces.  In JSPWiki data model, 
all wikis are in a single workspace, so we don't in particular need multiple
workspaces.

A Session presents one particular set of credentials to the workspace.  In Priha,
there is a single provider instance which is used to manage all of the sessions.
