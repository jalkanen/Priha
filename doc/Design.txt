This is a light-weight, non-compliant implementation of the JSR-170 Java Content Repository API.

DATA MODEL
==========

The data model is rather straightforward.

REPOSITORY MODEL
================

TBD

VERSIONING MODEL
================

Versions are stored under /jcr:system/jcr:versionStorage/

Each VersionHistory object is stored as

/jcr:system/jcr:versionStorage/<uuid>

Each Version object is stored under as a child of the VersionHistory object, as follows:

/jcr:system/jcr:versionStorage/<uuid>/<versionName>

Individual providers can then use whatever mechanism they want to store the pages. A
subdirectory structure is recommended, since this can grow rather wildly.
