Things that Priha does not even attempt to currently do:

* Property constraints

* Same name siblings - only single nodes
   * Orderable child nodes

* Versioning

* All referential integrity things

* Full protection of all built-in types

* Transactions

* Stored queries

* SQL queries (only XPath is supported)
