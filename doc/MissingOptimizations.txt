Optimizations that could be done:

* FileProvider.mangleName() is called several times - should really call 
  just once per file name resolve
* itemExists() should really not call the provider twice; have an 
  Provider.itemExists(Workspace, Path, ItemType?)
* SessionProvider.getProperties() iterates way too much
* FileProvider.remove() should not be calling getPropertyInfo()
* NodeImpl.hasProperty() should use itemExists() and not load via
  SessionImpl.hasProperty()
* ProviderManager.getItem() is calling loadNode() twice
* ProviderManager.loadNode() is slow, so it should be avoided when
  getting property values
* Some new thinking is needed - a single getItem() needs four calls
  into the repo in case of properties: one failed loadNode(),
  then a loadNode() [which calls getPropertyValue()], then a 
  getPropertyValue() for the actual value.
* Since Node/PropertyDefinitions are really only needed at
  setProperty()/addNode(), perhaps they could be loaded lazily?
* SessionProvider.listNodes() calls getInternalPath() way too
  often

Optimizations which have been done:
* GenericIterator.skip() is really slow; should actually use the
  underlying iterator to do the skipping. DONE
* SessionProvider.getProperties() should really only get the item names, 
  not the items. DONE
