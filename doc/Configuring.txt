Configuring Priha
=================

TBD

THE PROPERTY FILE
=================

By default, Priha looks for the "priha.properties" file from your classpath, both
under the classpath root as well as /WEB-INF/.


Providers
---------

Priha does not yet support multiple providers, but the configuration makes
you think it does.

First, you define a provider and give it a nickname; in the following example
it's "myProvider".

    priha.provider.myProvider.class = org.mycompany.priha.MyProvider

You can also define more properties to your provider.  These are appended
to the nick.

    priha.provider.myProvider.param1 = value1

This would be passed to the MyProvider instance as "param1" with a value of "value1".

Finally, you declare which provider you want to use by listing its nickname in the
"priha.providers" parameter.

    priha.providers = myProvider



The defaultProvider
-------------------

The nickname "defaultProvider" is reserved for the built-in default provider
(which is a FileProvider).  You can look at the FileProvider javadocs to
see what configuration options it has.

Priha uses the defaultProvider in the absence of any other "priha.providers" line.


LOGGING
=======

Priha uses the Java 5 "java.util.logging" package.  Yes, it could use commons-logging,
but one of the goals was to reduce the amount of external library dependencies.
So there.
