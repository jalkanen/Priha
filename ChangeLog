        * 0.3.2
        
        * Workspace.copy() did not allow copying to nodes with same
        name siblings enabled.  Now fixed.
        
2009-09-21  Janne Jalkanen <jalkanen@ecyrd.com>

        * 0.3.1
        
        * Vastly improved speeds for MemoryProvider by redesigning the 
        memory structure.  For example, removal is no longer an O(N^2) 
        operation, but O(log N).
        
2009-09-17  Janne Jalkanen <jalkanen@ecyrd.com>

        * 0.3.0
        
        * FileProvider now stores the order in which Nodes are stored to
        support orderable child nodes.  JDBCProvider does not do so yet.
        
        * Bigger changes in the Provider API - introduced StoreTransaction
        for making sure that changes can be rolled back in case there is
        a failure (for those providers which support it).

        * JDBC supports now references
        
        * Fixed issues with JDBC startup (was recreating the database on every
        single startup, oops)
        
        * Fixed Date format stream format.

2009-09-12  Janne Jalkanen <jalkanen@ecyrd.com>

        * 0.2.2
        
        * Enhanced RepositoryProvider.getPropertyValue() to also transmit
        the type of the Value.  The API changed again.

        * 0.2.1
        
        * Rewrote Lock implementation, and introduced QLock.  This got
        rid of some annoying lock errors relating to session expiration.
        Only TCK tests failing at this point relate to same-name siblings.

        * 0.2.0
        
        * Rewrote JDBC Provider a bit to keep it compatible with JDK5 & 6.
        For future reference: Implementing JDK interfaces is not a good idea.
        
        * Changed the signatures of some of the RepositoryProvider interfaces,
        therefore causing a bump in version number.  The changes were just
        some exceptions being added so that all methods can now throw
        RepositoryExceptions. 
        
2009-09-11  Janne Jalkanen <jalkanen@ecyrd.com>

        * 0.1.40
        
        * Implemented JDBC connection pooling for JdbcProvider.
        
        * Changed JDBC setup script location; it's now based on 
        the result of Connection.getMetaData().getDatabaseProductName().
        
2009-09-06  Janne Jalkanen <jalkanen@ecyrd.com>

        * 0.1.39
        
        * JdbcProvider now has separate SQL setup scripts based on
        the driver class.
        
        * Added support for H2 database
        
        * Replaced HSQLDB with H2 database in tests; seems more reliable.
   
   	    * 0.1.38
   	    
   	    * Path operations now avoid Path.toString() to provide some
   	    speedups.
   	    
   	    * Overall speedups, tweaks and code cleanup.
   	    
2009-08-30  Janne Jalkanen <jalkanen@ecyrd.com>
   
   	    * 0.1.37
   	    
   	    * Fixed a couple of locking tests.  Introduced Node tagging
   	    (see NodeImpl.tag()).
   	    
2009-08-30  Janne Jalkanen <jalkanen@ecyrd.com>
   
   	    * 0.1.36
   		
   		* Some cleanup around EhCachingProvider. Now has a new setting
   		"maxSize" for determining how large objects should be cached.
   		
        * 0.1.35
        
        * Introduced PathRef to make Items no longer tied to a
        particular Path. This incidentally also improves performance
        quite a bit for inter-Session fetches.
        
2009-08-24  Janne Jalkanen <jalkanen@ecyrd.com>
   
        * 0.1.34
        
        * Fixed child lock tests; misunderstanding of JCR spec, oops :)
        
2009-08-24  Janne Jalkanen <jalkanen@ecyrd.com>
   
        * 0.1.33
        
        * Fixed Path.Component.equals() - this unfortunately meant
        duplication of the QName class.
        
        * Added FastPropertyStore, which is not yet completely optimized.

2009-08-23  Janne Jalkanen <jalkanen@ecyrd.com>
   
        * 0.1.32
        
        * Path.resolve() is now optimized for the most common cases.
        
        * Workspace init sped up.
        
        * PerformanceTest improved to allow for command-line arguments.
        Also removed Session leaks from emptyRepo();
        
2009-08-22  Janne Jalkanen <jalkanen@ecyrd.com>
   
        * 0.1.31
        
        * Fixed some leaking filehandles from FileProvider.

2009-08-18  Janne Jalkanen <jalkanen@ecyrd.com>
   
        * 0.1.30
        
        * Fixed QueryImpl.getColumnNames() to default to the proper
        node constraint; was happily returning everything that was found...
        (JCR spec not too specific about this part, had to dig through
        some Jackrabbit mailing lists...) 
        
        * Implemented multivalue matching.
        
2009-08-17  Janne Jalkanen <jalkanen@ecyrd.com>
   
        * 0.1.29
        
        * Fixed a number of issues on queries; including range queries
        and queries on same-name siblings.
        
        * Improved repository layout for JCR TCK tests to actually
        have content for queries...

2009-08-15  Janne Jalkanen <jalkanen@ecyrd.com>
   
        * 0.1.28
        
        * Fixed some issues with XML importing; the determination whether
        a property was multi or single was confused in quite a few cases.
        
        * Fixed issue where Session.move() constraints were not observed -
        now you no longer can save a target node without saving the source
        node and vice versa.
        
        * Fixed issue with NodeType.canAddChildNode() which was not properly
        adhering to JSR-170, but was being overly lenient.
        
2009-08-02  Janne Jalkanen <jalkanen@ecyrd.com>
   
        * 0.1.27
        
        * Implemented initial same name sibling support; clone and
        move still do not work.
        
2009-07-30  Janne Jalkanen <jalkanen@ecyrd.com>
   
        * 0.1.26
        
        * Implemented query ordering.
        
2009-07-29  Janne Jalkanen <jalkanen@ecyrd.com>
   
        * 0.1.25

		* Workspace.clone() now works as well, completing support for
		corresponding nodes and workspace cloning. Yay!

        * Implemented rudimentary access control - calling Repository.login()
        now creates a readonly session.  Any credentials (even empty) create 
        a read-write session.
        
        * Implemented Document view import
        
        * Fixed some caching issues with SessionProvider.
		
2009-07-28  Janne Jalkanen <jalkanen@ecyrd.com>
   
        * 0.1.24
        
        * Node.update() now works.  Also, all root nodes are now also
        mix:referenceable with a known UUID. 
        
2009-07-28  Janne Jalkanen <jalkanen@ecyrd.com>
   
        * 0.1.23
        
        * FileProvider now properly stores UUIDs per workspace,
        as opposed to being global (oops - but the JCR spec *is* confusing
        in this regard; Univerally Unique IDs are not actually unique...)
        
        * Session.move() was checking for a wrong lock.
        
2009-07-27  Janne Jalkanen <jalkanen@ecyrd.com>
   
        * 0.1.22
        
        * Massively improved FileProvider save speed by implementing
        journaling for the UUID and Reference storage.

2009-07-14  Janne Jalkanen <jalkanen@ecyrd.com>
   
        * 0.1.21

        * Stored query support added.

2009-07-12  Janne Jalkanen <jalkanen@ecyrd.com>
   
        * 0.1.20
        
        * A fairly massive update on versioning; cleaned up a lots
        of strangeness relating to deletion.
        
2009-06-15  Janne Jalkanen <jalkanen@ecyrd.com>

        * 0.1.19
        
        * Implemented Version.getAllVersions().

2009-06-14  Janne Jalkanen <jalkanen@ecyrd.com>

        * 0.1.18
        
        * The basic query language is now supported mostly. ORring
        queries are not yet supported.

2009-05-16  Janne Jalkanen <jalkanen@ecyrd.com>

        * 0.1.17

        * Workspace.move() implemented. Also cleaned some TCK failures
        relating to locks.

2009-05-10  Janne Jalkanen <jalkanen@ecyrd.com>

        * 0.1.16
        
        * FileProvider was reading strings in platform encoding,
        not UTF-8.  Oops.
        
        * StringValueImpl no longer forces SCALAR interpretation
        of the value, thus immensely easing debugging by making
        toString() idempotent.

2009-03-11  Janne Jalkanen <jalkanen@ecyrd.com>

        * 0.1.15
        
        * Implemented jcr:contains() function in XPath queries.

2009-02-17  Janne Jalkanen <jalkanen@ecyrd.com>

        * 0.1.14
        
        * Massive speed optimizations by improving caching in
        SessionProvider.

2009-02-15  Janne Jalkanen <jalkanen@ecyrd.com>

        * 0.1.13
        
        * Session is now a bit more fussy about when it's live.

2008-12-07  Janne Jalkanen <jalkanen@ecyrd.com>

        * 0.1.12
        
        * XPath queries now work.  We now use the Apache Jackrabbit
        Abstract Query Tree parser, but provide our own resolvers.
        Thanks heaps :-).  Not all of the predicates work, and
        neither do any of the functions yet.  But the core is there.

2008-11-24  Janne Jalkanen <jalkanen@ecyrd.com>

        * 0.1.11

        * Added org.priha.j2ee.JNDIRegistrationServlet to allow for
        JNDI-based initialization in a J2EE application.

2008-11-14  Janne Jalkanen <jalkanen@ecyrd.com>

        * 0.1.10
        
        * Fixed most of locking tests (now we actually remove locks
        when you delete a node).

2008-10-23  Janne Jalkanen <jalkanen@ecyrd.com>

        * 0.1.9
        
        * Fixed a few failing nodetype unit tests.

2008-10-21  Janne Jalkanen <jalkanen@ecyrd.com>

        * 0.1.8
        
        * Implemented XPath query API.  It kind of works, but it is pretty
        slow and does not yet support any of the JCR functions.
        
2008-10-13  Janne Jalkanen <jalkanen@ecyrd.com>

        * 0.1.7
        
        * Fixed issue with wrong exception if the Node was moved by
        another session and then saved.
        
        * Test failures at 55 out of 584.

2008-10-13  Janne Jalkanen <jalkanen@ecyrd.com>

        * 0.1.6
        
        * Implemented Workspace.copy().

2008-10-12  Janne Jalkanen <jalkanen@ecyrd.com>

        * 0.1.5
        
        * Document view export is now supported.  Versioning also
        seems to mostly work.
        
        * Test failures now 83/584.

2008-10-09  Janne Jalkanen <jalkanen@ecyrd.com>

        * 0.1.4
        
        * Fixed a number of versioning unit tests by implementing
        Node.isCheckedOut()...

2008-10-06  Janne Jalkanen <jalkanen@ecyrd.com>

        * 0.1.3
        
        * Massive reoptimization of FileProvider to do reference management
        properly.  This also meant some additions to the Provider API.

2008-10-01  Janne Jalkanen <jalkanen@ecyrd.com>

        * 0.1.2
        
        * XML Import works again
        
        * Item state changes are now replicated within a Session
        properly.
        
        * Test fails: 115/584.

2008-09-29  Janne Jalkanen <jalkanen@ecyrd.com>

        * 0.1.1
        
        * Massive changes to the internal workings; Priha now
        correctly stores QNames internally as much as it can,
        converting to the correct namespace mapping at the last
        instance.  Total fail rate for tests: 130/584.

2008-08-22  Janne Jalkanen <jalkanen@ecyrd.com>

        * 0.1.0
        
        * Renamed packages to org.priha.

2008-08-21  Janne Jalkanen <jalkanen@ecyrd.com>

        * 0.0.30
        
        * Turned on versioning support; still doesn't work but
        at least some of the classes are there.
        
        * Initial implementation of namespace remapping; something
        is still missing though.

2008-08-17  Janne Jalkanen <jalkanen@ecyrd.com>

        * 0.0.29
        
        * XML Import now works for System View.  All SerializationTest
        tests now pass.  Total fail rate for tests is 110 / 584.

2008-08-11  Janne Jalkanen <jalkanen@ecyrd.com>

        * 0.0.28
        
        * Fixed a number of issues with XML import (still does not work yet).
        
        * New pass rate for TCK tests is 126 fails out of 584 tests.

2008-08-03  Janne Jalkanen <jalkanen@ecyrd.com>

        * 0.0.27
        
        * FileProvider now closes the files it opens (and no longer
        runs out of filehandles, hopefully).

2008-08-03  Janne Jalkanen <jalkanen@ecyrd.com>

        * 0.0.26
        
        * Started work on XML System View import.

2008-08-01  Janne Jalkanen <jalkanen@ecyrd.com>

        * 0.0.25
        
        * Added copyright preambles.
        
        * Lock rework.
        
        * Added the latest TCK tests from Jackrabbit repo.  While these
        are not the official TCK tests, they are at least bugfixed.
        The pass rate went down though.

2008-07-23  Janne Jalkanen <jalkanen@ecyrd.com>

        * 0.0.24

        * Implemented initial locking support.  Lock tests currently fail
        9 out of 19.
        
        * Total fails 38 out of 454.

        * Added JdbcProvider (though the schema is pretty much braindead)
        
        * Added MemoryProvider (for anyone who wants to do testing)
        
        * Added performance tests

2008-07-20  Janne Jalkanen <jalkanen@ecyrd.com>

        * 0.0.23
        
        * Read through the workspace section of JCR spec again,
        slapped forehead, and added multiple workspace support.
        
        * Node.getCorrespondingNodePath() works now, though without
        any constraint checking yet.
        
        * Added javadoc generation.
        
        * 39 out of 454 TCK tests fail now.

        * 0.0.22
        
        * Session.move() works now.
        
2008-07-19  Janne Jalkanen <jalkanen@ecyrd.com>

        * 0.0.21
        
        * Fixed multiple provider support; now it actually works.
        
2008-07-18  Janne Jalkanen <jalkanen@ecyrd.com>

        * 0.0.20
        
        * Added ability to manage multiple providers (though this
        does not quite work yet).  Also improved documentation
        on configuration (in doc/Configuration.txt) quite a bit.

        * 0.0.19
        
        * Added the EhCachingProvider to provide a significant boost
        to content access.
        
        * Added PathFactory to make memory consumption lighter
        
        * Some minor optimizations here and there.
        
        * TCK fails: 48/454.

        * 0.0.18
        
        * Fixed a number of minor conversion exceptions (jeez the TCK
        is tight).  49/454 failures...
        
        * Reworked configuration completely (it works now) and added
        some basic documentation about the configuration to 
        doc/Configuration.txt

2008-07-16  Janne Jalkanen <jalkanen@ecyrd.com>

        * 0.0.17
        
        * Added system view XML export, and fixed some error
        conditions to achieve a nice fail figure of 74/454.

        * 0.0.16
        
        * Added basic binary support.  Fails: 95/454.

2008-07-15  Janne Jalkanen <jalkanen@ecyrd.com>

        * 0.0.15
        
        * Fails: 103 out of 454.  Some minor performance
        optimization as well.

2008-07-15  Janne Jalkanen <jalkanen@ecyrd.com>

        * 0.0.14
        
        * Massive reworking of pretty much everything.  Fails
        140 out of 454 TCK tests, which is the best result so far.
        
        * Path is now faster than before.

2008-07-02  Janne Jalkanen <jalkanen@ecyrd.com>

        * 0.0.13
        
        * Major changes to storage managemement.  This version

        parent path.

        * FileProvider also now reads configuration from Preferences
        object.

        * 0.0.6

        * Implemented UUID support

2007-02-11  Janne Jalkanen <jalkanen@ecyrd.com>

        * 0.0.4

        * Reworked the SPI a bit; now reading the repository
        in at startup works.  It's nowhere near optimal, tho'.

2007-02-11  Janne Jalkanen <jalkanen@ecyrd.com>

        * 0.0.3
