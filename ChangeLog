2009-12-24  Janne Jalkanen <jalkanen@ecyrd.com>

        * 0.6.5
        
        * Fixed an off-by-one problem with SNS reordering; all internal
        unit tests run now too!
        
        * 0.6.4
        
        * Fixed some more issues with SNS reordering. This version now
        passes the JSR-170 TCK with zero errors or failures.
        
        * Merry Christmas!

2009-12-23  Janne Jalkanen <jalkanen@ecyrd.com>

        * 0.6.3

        * Solved a fairly hairy graph matching issue in SimpleQueryProvider,
        and I think finally deep queries work as they are meant to work. Yay!
        
2009-12-22  Janne Jalkanen <jalkanen@ecyrd.com>

        * 0.6.2
        
        * Rewrote ItemState handling to clean up some cases where
        ChangeStore got awfully confused as to when something was updated
        or not.  This also fixes some problems with SNS handling, which
        isn't still perfect though. It also changes reliability of
        multiple move()s in a single Session.

2009-12-05  Janne Jalkanen <jalkanen@ecyrd.com>

        * Bug 7: Running perftest is now possible even when Jackrabbit
        does not exist. Thanks to Kees Kuip.
        
        * Bug 6: compile and compiletests -targets had wrong dirsets.
        Thanks to Kees Kuip pointing this out.

		* ant clean would also delete generated sources - needing a
		svn update. Now fixed.

2009-11-24  Janne Jalkanen <jalkanen@ecyrd.com>

        * 0.6.1
        
        * Slightly improved FileProvider serialization algorithm - the
        garbage collection is only performed every 30 seconds, tops.
        
        * Bug fix: XML serialization in System view would generate
        in some cases multi-valued properties when only single values
        were serialized.

2009-10-30  Janne Jalkanen <jalkanen@ecyrd.com>

        * 0.6.0
        
        * Improved repository startup speed by a factor of four; replaced
        XPath.evaluate() with custom code.
        
        * FileProvider storage format changed slightly to avoid colons
        and non-letters as starting characters in file/dir names.  Need
        someone to test this on Windows.
        
2009-10-30  Janne Jalkanen <jalkanen@ecyrd.com>

        * 0.5.7
        
        * FileProvider is now case-sensitive even on case-insensitive file
        systems. 
        
2009-10-26  Janne Jalkanen <jalkanen@ecyrd.com>

        * 0.5.6
        
        * SessionProvider.checkSanity() was using the moved path for sanity
        checks, not the originator path. Oops.

2009-10-25  Janne Jalkanen <jalkanen@ecyrd.com>

        * 0.5.5
        
        * Added RepositoryImpl.shutdown() to facilitate repository restarts.
        
2009-10-15  Janne Jalkanen <jalkanen@ecyrd.com>

        * 0.5.4
        
        * Bug fix: Item.isNew() was returning false when a mixin was added.
        Reported by Andrew Jaquith.
        
        * Same-name-siblings added again; however, Node.orderBefore() does not
        work at the moment. 
        
2009-10-12  Janne Jalkanen <jalkanen@ecyrd.com>

        * 0.5.3
        
        * Fixed ValueFactoryImpl.createValue(Value) to make proper clones
        also for Calendar values.
        
2009-10-12  Janne Jalkanen <jalkanen@ecyrd.com>

        * 0.5.2
        
        * Fixed a number of leftover problems; again down to 8 failures on TCK.
        SNS support still disabled, but all failing tests are related to SNS...
        This version should fix most of the problems introduced in 0.5.0.

        * 0.5.1
        
        * Moved Path* classes to its own package: org.priha.path, since util-package
        was perhaps growing a bit too much.
        
2009-10-11  Janne Jalkanen <jalkanen@ecyrd.com>

        * 0.5.0
        
        * Rewrote changes handling since there were a couple of fairly serious
        dataloss bugs in it.  It's now a bit more robust, and it uncovered
        a number of other issues as well.  Unfortunately, the work is not yet
        complete, and SNS support is disabled for now.  This commit is considerably
        more unstable than 0.4.1, so upgrading not recommended.
        
        * RepositoryProvider.putProperyValue() signature changed; therefore
        new minor version bump.
        
2009-10-02  Janne Jalkanen <jalkanen@ecyrd.com>

        * 0.4.1
        
        * Orderable child nodes now implemented in JdbcProvider as well.
        
        * Fixed issue with FileProvider accidentally losing the index
        of the SNS.
        
2009-09-27  Janne Jalkanen <jalkanen@ecyrd.com>

        * 0.4.0
        
        * Implemented orderable child nodes (though not yet for
        same name siblings) with FileProvider. This caused some
        minor changes in the Provider API.
        
        * Fixed minor problem in XML import which was failing a number
        of test cases.  We no longer import jcr:baseVersion as a reference
        since we don't yet support importing version histories.
        
2009-09-27  Janne Jalkanen <jalkanen@ecyrd.com>

        * 0.3.5
        
        * Added nt:folder nodetype, which was missing for some reason.
        
        * MemoryProvider now supports changing the workspace name.
        
2009-09-26  Janne Jalkanen <jalkanen@ecyrd.com>

        * 0.3.4
        
        * Made most of our providers really thread-safe by enabling
        MultiThreadTest.

        * 0.3.3
        
        * PathManager is now a singleton; which solves quite a few
        XML import problems - sharing Paths between multiple Sessions did
        not work (I have no idea what I was thinking when I made PathManager
        depend on a Session...)

        * 0.3.2
        
        * Workspace.copy() did not allow copying to nodes with same
        name siblings enabled.  Now fixed.
        
        * Fixed addNode() to support adding to indexed nodes; it was
        erroneusly thinking that /foo/bar[2]/blat is an illegal Node
        name...
        
2009-09-21  Janne Jalkanen <jalkanen@ecyrd.com>

        * 0.3.1
        
        * Vastly improved speeds for MemoryProvider by redesigning the 
        memory structure.  For example, removal is no longer an O(N^2) 
        operation, but O(log N).
        
2009-09-17  Janne Jalkanen <jalkanen@ecyrd.com>

        * 0.3.0
        
        * FileProvider now stores the order in which Nodes are stored to
        support orderable child nodes.  JDBCProvider does not do so yet.
        
        * Bigger changes in the Provider API - introduced StoreTransaction
        for making sure that changes can be rolled back in case there is
        a failure (for those providers which support it).

        * JDBC supports now references
        
        * Fixed issues with JDBC startup (was recreating the database on every
        single startup, oops)
        
        * Fixed Date format stream format.

2009-09-12  Janne Jalkanen <jalkanen@ecyrd.com>

        * 0.2.2
        
        * Enhanced RepositoryProvider.getPropertyValue() to also transmit
        the type of the Value.  The API changed again.

        * 0.2.1
        
        * Rewrote Lock implementation, and introduced QLock.  This got
        rid of some annoying lock errors relating to session expiration.
        Only TCK tests failing at this point relate to same-name siblings.

        * 0.2.0
        
        * Rewrote JDBC Provider a bit to keep it compatible with JDK5 & 6.
        For future reference: Implementing JDK interfaces is not a good idea.
        
        * Changed the signatures of some of the RepositoryProvider interfaces,
        therefore causing a bump in version number.  The changes were just
        some exceptions being added so that all methods can now throw
        RepositoryExceptions. 
        
2009-09-11  Janne Jalkanen <jalkanen@ecyrd.com>

        * 0.1.40
        
        * Implemented JDBC connection pooling for JdbcProvider.
        
        * Changed JDBC setup script location; it's now based on 
        the result of Connection.getMetaData().getDatabaseProductName().
        
2009-09-06  Janne Jalkanen <jalkanen@ecyrd.com>

        * 0.1.39
        
        * JdbcProvider now has separate SQL setup scripts based on
        the driver class.
        
        * Added support for H2 database
        
        * Replaced HSQLDB with H2 database in tests; seems more reliable.
   
   	    * 0.1.38
   	    
   	    * Path operations now avoid Path.toString() to provide some
   	    speedups.
   	    
   	    * Overall speedups, tweaks and code cleanup.
   	    
2009-08-30  Janne Jalkanen <jalkanen@ecyrd.com>
   
   	    * 0.1.37
   	    
   	    * Fixed a couple of locking tests.  Introduced Node tagging
   	    (see NodeImpl.tag()).
   	    
2009-08-30  Janne Jalkanen <jalkanen@ecyrd.com>
   
   	    * 0.1.36
   		
   		* Some cleanup around EhCachingProvider. Now has a new setting
   		"maxSize" for determining how large objects should be cached.
   		
        * 0.1.35
        
        * Introduced PathRef to make Items no longer tied to a
        particular Path. This incidentally also improves performance
        quite a bit for inter-Session fetches.
        
2009-08-24  Janne Jalkanen <jalkanen@ecyrd.com>
   
        * 0.1.34
        
        * Fixed child lock tests; misunderstanding of JCR spec, oops :)
        
2009-08-24  Janne Jalkanen <jalkanen@ecyrd.com>
   
        * 0.1.33
        
        * Fixed Path.Component.equals() - this unfortunately meant
        duplication of the QName class.
        
        * Added FastPropertyStore, which is not yet completely optimized.

2009-08-23  Janne Jalkanen <jalkanen@ecyrd.com>
   
        * 0.1.32
        
        * Path.resolve() is now optimized for the most common cases.
        
        * Workspace init sped up.
        
        * PerformanceTest improved to allow for command-line arguments.
        Also removed Session leaks from emptyRepo();
        
2009-08-22  Janne Jalkanen <jalkanen@ecyrd.com>
   
        * 0.1.31
        
        * Fixed some leaking filehandles from FileProvider.

2009-08-18  Janne Jalkanen <jalkanen@ecyrd.com>
   
        * 0.1.30
        
        * Fixed QueryImpl.getColumnNames() to default to the proper
        node constraint; was happily returning everything that was found...
        (JCR spec not too specific about this part, had to dig through
        some Jackrabbit mailing lists...) 
        
        * Implemented multivalue matching.
        
2009-08-17  Janne Jalkanen <jalkanen@ecyrd.com>
   
        * 0.1.29
        
        * Fixed a number of issues on queries; including range queries
        and queries on same-name siblings.
        
        * Improved repository layout for JCR TCK tests to actually
        have content for queries...

2009-08-15  Janne Jalkanen <jalkanen@ecyrd.com>
   
        * 0.1.28
        
        * Fixed some issues with XML importing; the determination whether
        a property was multi or single was confused in quite a few cases.
        
        * Fixed issue where Session.move() constraints were not observed -
        now you no longer can save a target node without saving the source
        node and vice versa.
        
        * Fixed issue with NodeType.canAddChildNode() which was not properly
        adhering to JSR-170, but was being overly lenient.
        
2009-08-02  Janne Jalkanen <jalkanen@ecyrd.com>
   
        * 0.1.27
        
        * Implemented initial same name sibling support; clone and
        move still do not work.
        
2009-07-30  Janne Jalkanen <jalkanen@ecyrd.com>
   
        * 0.1.26
        
        * Implemented query ordering.
        
2009-07-29  Janne Jalkanen <jalkanen@ecyrd.com>
   
        * 0.1.25

		* Workspace.clone() now works as well, completing support for
		corresponding nodes and workspace cloning. Yay!

        * Implemented rudimentary access control - calling Repository.login()
        now creates a readonly session.  Any credentials (even empty) create 
        a read-write session.
        
        * Implemented Document view import
        
        * Fixed some caching issues with SessionProvider.
		
2009-07-28  Janne Jalkanen <jalkanen@ecyrd.com>
   
        * 0.1.24
        
        * Node.update() now works.  Also, all root nodes are now also
        mix:referenceable with a known UUID. 
        
2009-07-28  Janne Jalkanen <jalkanen@ecyrd.com>
   
        * 0.1.23
        
        * FileProvider now properly stores UUIDs per workspace,
        as opposed to being global (oops - but the JCR spec *is* confusing
        in this regard; Univerally Unique IDs are not actually unique...)
        
        * Session.move() was checking for a wrong lock.
        
2009-07-27  Janne Jalkanen <jalkanen@ecyrd.com>
   
        * 0.1.22
        
        * Massively improved FileProvider save speed by implementing
        journaling for the UUID and Reference storage.

2009-07-14  Janne Jalkanen <jalkanen@ecyrd.com>
   
        * 0.1.21

        * Stored query support added.

2009-07-12  Janne Jalkanen <jalkanen@ecyrd.com>
   
        * 0.1.20
        
        * A fairly massive update on versioning; cleaned up a lots
        of strangeness relating to deletion.
        
2009-06-15  Janne Jalkanen <jalkanen@ecyrd.com>

        * 0.1.19
        
        * Implemented Version.getAllVersions().

2009-06-14  Janne Jalkanen <jalkanen@ecyrd.com>

        * 0.1.18
        
        * The basic query language is now supported mostly. ORring
        queries are not yet supported.

2009-05-16  Janne Jalkanen <jalkanen@ecyrd.com>

        * 0.1.17

        * Workspace.move() implemented. Also cleaned some TCK failures
        relating to locks.

2009-05-10  Janne Jalkanen <jalkanen@ecyrd.com>

        * 0.1.16
        
        * FileProvider was reading strings in platform encoding,
        not UTF-8.  Oops.
        
        * StringValueImpl no longer forces SCALAR interpretation
        of the value, thus immensely easing debugging by making
        toString() idempotent.

2009-03-11  Janne Jalkanen <jalkanen@ecyrd.com>

        * 0.1.15
        
        * Implemented jcr:contains() function in XPath queries.

2009-02-17  Janne Jalkanen <jalkanen@ecyrd.com>

        * 0.1.14
        
        * Massive speed optimizations by improving caching in
        SessionProvider.

2009-02-15  Janne Jalkanen <jalkanen@ecyrd.com>

        * 0.1.13
        
        * Session is now a bit more fussy about when it's live.

2008-12-07  Janne Jalkanen <jalkanen@ecyrd.com>

        * 0.1.12
        
        * XPath queries now work.  We now use the Apache Jackrabbit
        Abstract Query Tree parser, but provide our own resolvers.
        Thanks heaps :-).  Not all of the predicates work, and
        neither do any of the functions yet.  But the core is there.

2008-11-24  Janne Jalkanen <jalkanen@ecyrd.com>

        * 0.1.11

        * Added org.priha.j2ee.JNDIRegistrationServlet to allow for
        JNDI-based initialization in a J2EE application.

2008-11-14  Janne Jalkanen <jalkanen@ecyrd.com>

        * 0.1.10
        
        * Fixed most of locking tests (now we actually remove locks
        when you delete a node).

2008-10-23  Janne Jalkanen <jalkanen@ecyrd.com>

        * 0.1.9
        
        * Fixed a few failing nodetype unit tests.

2008-10-21  Janne Jalkanen <jalkanen@ecyrd.com>

        * 0.1.8
        
        * Implemented XPath query API.  It kind of works, but it is pretty
        slow and does not yet support any of the JCR functions.
        
2008-10-13  Janne Jalkanen <jalkanen@ecyrd.com>

        * 0.1.7
        
        * Fixed issue with wrong exception if the Node was moved by
        another session and then saved.
        
        * Test failures at 55 out of 584.

2008-10-13  Janne Jalkanen <jalkanen@ecyrd.com>

        * 0.1.6
        
        * Implemented Workspace.copy().

2008-10-12  Janne Jalkanen <jalkanen@ecyrd.com>

        * 0.1.5
        
        * Document view export is now supported.  Versioning also
        seems to mostly work.
        
        * Test failures now 83/584.

2008-10-09  Janne Jalkanen <jalkanen@ecyrd.com>

        * 0.1.4
        
        * Fixed a number of versioning unit tests by implementing
        Node.isCheckedOut()...

2008-10-06  Janne Jalkanen <jalkanen@ecyrd.com>

        * 0.1.3
        
        * Massive reoptimization of FileProvider to do reference management
        properly.  This also meant some additions to the Provider API.

2008-10-01  Janne Jalkanen <jalkanen@ecyrd.com>

        * 0.1.2
        
        * XML Import works again
        
        * Item state changes are now replicated within a Session
        properly.
        
        * Test fails: 115/584.

2008-09-29  Janne Jalkanen <jalkanen@ecyrd.com>

        * 0.1.1
        
        * Massive changes to the internal workings; Priha now
        correctly stores QNames internally as much as it can,
        converting to the correct namespace mapping at the last
        instance.  Total fail rate for tests: 130/584.

2008-08-22  Janne Jalkanen <jalkanen@ecyrd.com>

        * 0.1.0
        
        * Renamed packages to org.priha.

2008-08-21  Janne Jalkanen <jalkanen@ecyrd.com>

        * 0.0.30
        
        * Turned on versioning support; still doesn't work but
        at least some of the classes are there.
        
        * Initial implementation of namespace remapping; something
        is still missing though.

2008-08-17  Janne Jalkanen <jalkanen@ecyrd.com>

        * 0.0.29
        
        * XML Import now works for System View.  All SerializationTest
        tests now pass.  Total fail rate for tests is 110 / 584.
