2008-11-14  Janne Jalkanen <jalkanen@ecyrd.com>

        * 0.1.10

        slow and does not yet support any of the JCR functions.

        * 0.1.1
        
        * Massive changes to the internal workings; Priha now
        correctly stores QNames internally as much as it can,
        converting to the correct namespace mapping at the last
        instance.  Total fail rate for tests: 130/584.

        at least some of the classes are there.
