This is Priha, a JSR-170 Java Content Repository implementation. 

GOALS
=====

The goals of the project are:

    * Provide a "good enough" implementation to ship with JSPWiki 3.0.
    
    * Optimize for fast fetching of medium-sized text objects (i.e.
      wikipages)
      
    * Good storage of large binaries (i.e. attachments)
      
    * Provide integrated versioning
    
    * Provide an SPI so that different types of providers can be used
      without hiding the JSR structure to something which cannot be
      understood by a mortal man.
      
    * Provide an SPI so powerful that JSPWiki can be easily migrated
      and keep the existing clarity of its Providers.
      
    * Scalability up to medium size systems (200 wikis, each with 2000 pages,
      total of 400,000 nodes).
    
    * Ships with as few external libraries as possible
    
The anti-goals (i.e. the things I don't particularly want to pay attention
to, because they are not useful (yet) in JSPWiki context) are:

    * Class 1 or Class 2 compliancy.  If it's not useful in JSPWiki context,
      it will be on the back burner.
      
    * Transactions support
    
    * HA or clustering support.  These should be left to an industrial-scale
      JSR implementation.
      
    * JNDI
    

REQUIREMENTS
============

Priha requires and takes advantage of Java 5 (JDK 1.5).  Priha requires no
other libraries; however to compile and run the JCR tests you need the included
libraries as well as the servlet-api.jar.
