This is Priha, a JSR-170 Java Content Repository implementation.  Unlike
the all-singing, all-dancing, fully CRM-certified implementations, Priha
is targeted at small applications, embedders and hobbyists, who like to
have a simple repository model with as few external dependencies as possible.

You can start off with Priha, and then just simply switch to a more efficient
solution (like Jackrabbit) once you start to need the performance / reliability.

The word "priha" is an ancient Finnish word and it roughly means a
"young man".  It is not in common use these days, except as an idiom
"ylen sankia priha" ("a very chubby young man").  Which, if you ever were
to use it correctly in the presence of a Finnish person, would probably get you
a free beer and plenty of questions.


GOALS
=====

The goals of the project are:

    * Provide a "good enough" implementation to ship with JSPWiki 3.0.
    
    * Optimize for fast fetching of medium-sized text objects (i.e.
      wikipages)
      
    * Good storage of large binaries (i.e. attachments)
      
    * Provide integrated versioning
    
    * Provide an SPI so that different types of providers can be used
      without hiding the JSR structure to something which cannot be
      understood by a mortal man.
      
    * Provide an SPI so powerful that JSPWiki can be easily migrated
      and keep the existing clarity of its Providers.
      
    * Scalability up to medium size systems (200 wikis, each with 2000 pages,
      total of 400,000 nodes).
    
    * Ships with as few external libraries as possible
    
The anti-goals (i.e. the things I don't particularly want to pay attention
to, because they are not useful (yet) in JSPWiki context) are:

    * Transactions support
    
    * HA or clustering support.  These should be left to an industrial-scale
      JSR implementation.
      
    * JNDI
    
    * Custom Nodetypes
    

REQUIREMENTS
============

Priha requires and takes advantage of Java 5 (JDK 1.5).  To compile and run the JCR 
tests you need the included libraries.

To run Priha, you need:
* a JAXP-compliant XML parser library somewhere in your classpath (the one with JDK5 is fine)
* jcr-1.0.jar somewhere in the classpath as well

That's it!

See doc/Configuration.txt for further information about how Priha is configured.
