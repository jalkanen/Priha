/**
 *  This is the main API for getting yourself a Repository object, and as 
 *  such, probably the only class you will need outside the basic JCR classes
 *  (unless you want to develop a RepositoryProvider, but that's a whole another story).
 *  <p>
 *  The simplest way of getting yourself a Priha JCR Repository is to simply call
 *  <code>RepositoryManager.getRepository</code>, which will find your "priha.properties"
 *  file and return a ready-to-use repository.  This default repository is a singleton.
 *  <p>
 *  Simple basic usage example which stores "some text" to the repository, and
 *  then retrieves and prints it:
 *  <pre>
 *     Repository rep = RepositoryManager.getRepository();
 *     Session session = rep.login();
 *     
 *     Node nd = session.getRootNode().addNode("myfirstnode");
 *     nd.addProperty("myfirstproperty", "some text");
 *     session.save();
 *     
 *     Property newp = (Property)session.getItem("/myfirstnode/myfirstproperty");
 *     System.out.println( newp.getString() );
 *  </pre>
 *
